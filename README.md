Asetniop is typing method that only uses ten keys. It is similar to stenography but without the very steep learning curve.
The main use of typing characters and words is through the use of 'chords' holding 2 or more keys together and releasing at the same time.

Since resources on Asetniop is obscure and finding resources to get started is rare, I would like store all info about asetniop in one place so its easy to find.

This includes on how to implenment asetniop on your computer or keyboard, and other helpful resources other users have made.

METHOD 1: USE AUTOHOTKEY

In the repository, I uploaded the original autohotkey source code on how to run asetniop on your computer.

I did not make the original code, all credit goes to the creator of asetniop, Zack Dennis.

Simply download AutoHotKey, create a new script and copy and paste the code. It is configured so that the home row are set to ASETNIOP and all bottom row letters are set to SHIFT.

One limitation is that this code doesn't contain only word chords only single characters. However it is the easiest way to get started and every beginners should memorize how 
to type every letter.

I would like to expand to code to include word chords of 250 most common English words.

Method 2: Using QMK

QMK is a keyboard customization software that allows extreme flexiblity on your keyboard. All changes on QMK happen at the hardware level meaning that once you make an asetniop
keyboard using QMK. You can have a plug and play ASETNIOP keyboard on any computer.
